        Gilgamesh was a hero in Mespopotamian Ancient Mythology which is said he ruled over Uruk between 2900-2350 BC. The Epic of Gilgamesh is the story of King Gilgamesh and his search for immortality.

    <h2>Enuma Elish</h2>
             
    <p>The Enuma Elish(The Seven Tablets of Creation)is a tale which explains the creation of how the world and mankind began.
        <Br>Mortor of the Stars Cretion of Heaven and Earth, EA is the non existant Sword of Rupture that because it is creation, it can also erase said creation into nothingness just how it all began.
        <Br>In Mesopotamian myth, it is said that Gilgamesh himself part man and part God can call upon the Enuma Elish(EA) itself to vanquish those who pose a threat to Uruk.
